Shine - Visualising Web Archive via Solr
========================================

This is a front-end for Solr indicies created using the warc-discovery package.

### Trend Analysis ###
* Basic idea is to have some parameterisable queries and axes, so that we can plot features 
like term freqency, element usage, licenses etc. over time, with a range of normalisation options:
    * As absolute numbers.
    * Percentage of resources.
    * Percentage of HTML resources.
    * ???

Here's the raw data for an example, like <blink>:

### Variations ###
To see if we can leverage the ssdeep hashes to indicate how much a page has changed over time, and spot large changes.

c.f. warc-discovery/analysis-tools/ssdiff.py

    
### Snowflakes ###

Host/Domain Snowflake:
- Pick a random slash page, perhaps from a given year, and keep going until we
get a domain with an significant number of pages. e.g. >50.
"fq=url_type:"slashpage"&sort=random_xxx+desc" get domain/host.
"fq=domain:"selected"" until you get a decent count.
- Then, get the links_private_suffixes for the random first up-to 1000 pages.
- Then turn that into a connectivity graph file.
- Then plot that, with weights/size/colour e.g. by number of links, making most linked-to domain clear.
- Lots of additions could be made, like back links on the same graph as an outer layer.
- Links links_hosts and links_private_suffixes as a tree might work well.

NB Can look up number of facet values via:

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/solr/The+Stats+Component

(use this to make faceted search saner)

### Domain Index ###

Domain index, i.e. all distinct slash pages ordered alphabetically.

URL/host summary page, including proxy-rendered archival shot.


### YOLO-15 ###

Use the Solr index to find pages from 15 years ago, and publish as a twitter feed (e.g. daily). Could be basic search with screenshots, or perhaps a bit more meaningful if we hook in a search for the test 'you only live once'.

### Old News ###

Pull tweets from BBC news, look for old news articles that 'match'.
